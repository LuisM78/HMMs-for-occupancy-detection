Repository hosting the files for "A methodology based on Hidden Markov Models for occupancy detection and a case study in a low energy residential building" 
The files will be uploaded shortly! Thank you for your patience.

The *.Rmd  file has the scripts to produce the html file (which you can see in your browser) it has the results reported in the tables in the paper for the accuracies of the different models for different time windows.
